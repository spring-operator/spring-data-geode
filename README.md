Spring Data for Apache Geode
============================

The primary goal of the [Spring Data for Apache Geode](https://projects.spring.io/spring-data-gemfire) project is to 
make it easier to build highly scalable, _Spring_ powered applications using [Apache Geode](https://geode.apache.org/) 
as the underlying distributed, in-memory data management platform.

# Examples

For examples on using the _Spring Data for Apache Geode_, see the 
[spring-gemfire-examples](https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-gemfire-examples) project.

# Getting Help

Read the main project [website](https://projects.spring.io/spring-data-gemfire/) along with the [User Guide](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data-gemfire/docs/current/reference/html/).

Look at the source code and the [JavaDocs](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data-gemfire/docs/current/api/).

If you are new to _Spring_ as well as _Spring Data for Apache Geode_, look for information about 
[Spring projects](https://spring.io/projects).

Quick Start
-----------

For those in a hurry:

* Download the jar through

* Maven:

~~~~~ xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-data-geode</artifactId>
  <version>${version}</version>
</dependency>

<!-- nightly builds -->
<repository>
  <id>spring-maven-snapshot</id>
  <name>Spring Maven SNAPSHOT Repository</name>
  <url>https://repo.spring.io/snapshot</url>
  <snapshots><enabled>true</enabled></snapshots>
</repository>

<!-- milestones/release candidates-->
<repository>
  <id>spring-maven-milestone</id>
  <name>Spring Maven Milestone Repository</name>
  <url>https://repo.spring.io/milestone</url>
</repository>
~~~~~

* Gradle:

~~~~~ groovy
repositories {
   mavenRepo name: "spring-snapshot", urls: "https://repo.spring.io/snapshot"
   mavenRepo name: "spring-milestone", urls: "https://repo.spring.io/milestone"
   mavenRepo name: "spring-plugins" , urls: "https://repo.spring.io/plugins-release"
}

dependencies {
   compile "org.springframework.data:spring-data-geode:${version}"
}
~~~~~

* Configure a Geode cache and Region (REPLICATE, PARTITION and so on):

~~~~~ xml
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
  xmlns:gfe="http://www.springframework.org/schema/geode"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance
  xsi:schemaLocation="
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/geode https://www.springframework.org/schema/geode/spring-geode.xsd">

  <gfe:cache/>

  <gfe:partitioned-region id="ExampleRegion" copies="2">

  <bean id="gemfireTemplate" class="org.springframework.data.gemfire.GemfireTemplate" p:region-ref="ExampleRegion"/>
</beans>
~~~~~

* Use the Region to read/write data:

~~~~~ java
region.put(Long.valueOf(1), new Person("Jane", "Smith"));
~~~~~

* And/Or `GemFireTemplate` to interact with Geode:

~~~~~ java
template.query("person = 1");
~~~~~

# Building

_Spring Data for Apache Geode_ uses Maven as its build system. To compile the project, simply type from the root folder
